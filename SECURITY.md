# Security Overview for SolStudy Application

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the SolStudy application.

## Security Features

### Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables have RLS enabled, restricting access based on user roles and ownership.
- **Consolidated RLS Policies**: Consistent policies across all tables with proper isolation between admin and regular user access.
- **Secure Functions**: Admin operations like password resets and privilege changes use security definer functions with timeouts and search path restrictions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for sensitive admin operations to prevent abuse.
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-related events including admin actions and authentication events.

### Authentication Security
- **Secure Password Requirements**: Enforced password complexity (length, special characters, numbers).
- **Login Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks by limiting login attempts.
- **Secure Session Management**: Proper session validation and cleanup.
- **Safe Offline Mode**: Special handling for offline operation that doesn't compromise security.

### Client-Side Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented CSP headers to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side.
- **Output Sanitization**: User-generated content is sanitized before display.
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data in localStorage is stored with expiration and proper structure.

### Code Structure
- **Security Service Layer**: Dedicated services for security functions.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling without leaking sensitive information.
- **UUID Validation**: All IDs are validated before use in database operations.

## Security Best Practices
- Use the secure functions provided in `securityService.ts` for all security-related operations.
- Always sanitize user input using the provided functions.
- Log all sensitive operations using the audit logging system.
- Ensure that admin operations follow the principle of least privilege.
- Keep all security-related code in the dedicated security services.

## Security Updates and Maintenance
Security features should be regularly reviewed and updated. When adding new functionality, consider:

1. **Access Control**: Does this feature need RLS policies?
2. **Input Validation**: Are all inputs properly validated?
3. **Audit Logging**: Are sensitive operations logged properly?
4. **Error Handling**: Are errors handled without leaking sensitive information?
5. **Rate Limiting**: Does this feature need rate limiting to prevent abuse?
